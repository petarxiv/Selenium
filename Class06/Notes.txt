Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 typed of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2. Javascript alerts browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium or cancel

To handle JS alerts
1.Simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. Prompt alert - enter the text and then click on


To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel

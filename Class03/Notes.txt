Selenium Class 3

Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?

-- developers will not provide all the locators in html
-- by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
--xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath?
- Absolute Xpath = starts from the starting node in html
is always starts with single slash (/)
e.g. /html/body/div/div/div

Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in the html
it always starts with double slash (/)

//Everything in brown is attribute
Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagname[@attribute=

Example: //input[@id, 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text()='text value']

Example:
//h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook. "

identifying elements by using contains method
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

Example:
//input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]

Starts-with all identify the element with partial starting variable
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

Example: //button[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

<div> -- division
<img> -- image
<h> -- header
<li> -- list
<ul> -- unordered list
<ol> -- ordered list
<br> -- breaking line

Advance Xpath
is based on parent and child, sibling relationships

identifying elements by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname

//input[@id= 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//tagname[@attribute= 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::tagname

//span[text()= '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/preceding-sibling::label

indetifying elements by parents
//tagname[@attribute= 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagName

//span[text() = '& Orders']parents::a

identifying an element by its ancestor
//tagname[@attribute= 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname

//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying element by index

(//img[@class= 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]

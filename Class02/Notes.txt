Selenium Class 2

What is WebElement?
- Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
e.g. button, textboxes, links

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is the browser's
internal view of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or Dev tools

Dev tools > go to the web browser and open the page and then click right click and INSPECT

Document --> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel...
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model -->it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of a webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identify webelements on the web page

8 Locators:
-ID
-Name
-TagName
-Xpath
-LinkText
-PartialLinkText
-Css Selector
-Classes

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple- tags || buttons, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue -- attribute value

Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g. linkText and partialLinkText are only used for Links


if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates
